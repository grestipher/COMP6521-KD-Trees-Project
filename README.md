All program files are standalone so whichever file you are running make sure the datasets are in the same directory and named correctly in the " if main " loop


For the demo only run the demo.py ,input whatever you are directed to input on the terminal

demo.py supports whatever combination of dimensions and runs a query on them

the report analytics folder contains all the prograams i used to make the graphics and the statistics for the report
